### Project Title: Comprehensive Traffic Accident Analysis and Prediction


#### Project Overview
In this project, you will analyze traffic accident data from multiple perspectives, create visualizations using Python and Tableau/Power BI, and develop predictive models to identify hotspots, severity, and enforcement recommendations.

#### Group Structure
- **Group Size**: 3 students
- **Roles**:
  - **Data Analyst**: Responsible for data cleaning, analysis, and Python scripting.
  - **Visualization Specialist**: Focuses on creating dashboards and integrating predictions.
  - **Researcher/Presenter**: Conducts background research, synthesizes findings, and prepares the final presentation.

#### Project Steps

1. **Data Preparation** (1 week)
   - **Data Analyst**: Clean and preprocess the accident dataset.
   - Ensure data integrity and address missing values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (1 week)
   - Analyze the data from various perspectives:
     - **Temporal Analysis**: Identify trends over time (daily, weekly, seasonal).
     - **Geospatial Analysis**: Map accident locations to identify hotspots.
     - **Severity Analysis**: Evaluate factors contributing to accident severity.
   - Create initial visualizations using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for insights.

3. **Predictive Modeling** (2 weeks)
   - **Data Analyst**: Develop machine learning models using Python (scikit-learn) to:
     - Predict accident hotspots based on historical data.
     - Assess factors influencing accident severity.
   - Test and validate models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision).

4. **Integration with Tableau/Power BI** (1 week)
   - **Visualization Specialist**: Import Python scripts into Tableau or Power BI to visualize predictions.
   - Create interactive dashboards to showcase:
     - Hotspot maps.
     - Severity distributions.
     - Predictive insights.

5. **Recommendation Development** (1 week)
   - **Researcher/Presenter**: Suggest enforcement strategies based on analysis:
     - Identify high-risk areas for targeted enforcement.
     - Propose safety measures and community initiatives.
   - Research best practices from similar regions or studies.

6. **Final Presentation** (1 week)
   - Prepare a cohesive presentation that includes:
     - Overview of the analysis process.
     - Key findings and visualizations.
     - Predictive model insights and recommendations.
   - Ensure each group member contributes to the presentation.

#### Deliverables
- **Data Analysis Report**: Document summarizing methods and findings.
- **Predictive Model Summary**: Details of the model used, including performance metrics.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A Tableau/Power BI dashboard showcasing key insights and predictions.
- **Final Presentation**: A comprehensive presentation for the class.

#### Assessment Criteria
- Depth and rigor of analysis.
- Quality and clarity of visualizations.
- Effectiveness of predictive models and integration.
- Practicality of recommendations based on findings.
